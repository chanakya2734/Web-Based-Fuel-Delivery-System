# Web-Based-Fuel-Delivery-System
This project developed a web-based fuel delivery system with three interfaces: customer, manager and delivery boy. Using the google API key, the system captures customer locations for  fuel delivery, which uses a MYSQL database managed user data, orders and delivery status. The manager interface track orders and delivery progress in real-time.
